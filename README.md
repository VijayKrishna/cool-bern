# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Cool Bern

This is a simple collection of memes created by the internet when US Sen. Bernie Sanders wore an iconic set of mittens with simple clothes to President Biden's inauguration.  

As an engineer, I regard the simplicity and functional nature of his outfit to be somewhat radical and comforting, especially on an occasion where everyone was otherwise dressed in their fanciest dresses.  

This is not an endorsement of his politics, or politics of any kind.  
Rather, it is a curation of internet memes inspired by a singular act of functional simiplicity. üôÇ
